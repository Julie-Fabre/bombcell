      "Automated spike sorting quality control was performed using BombCell (Fabre et al., 2023). Each unit was sequentially evaluated and classified as noise, non-somatic, multi-unit activity (MUA), and good single units, based on the quality metrics described below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noise and non-somatic quality metrics were derived from each unit's template waveform on its peak channel (the channel with the largest amplitude). Peaks and troughs were identified using a prominence-based peak-finding algorithm, with the minimum prominence threshold set to 0.2 times the waveform's absolute maximum. The main trough was defined as the most prominent trough, and peaks were detected separately on either side of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Units were first evaluated for noise-like waveform features. A unit was classified as noise if any of the following criteria were met: the waveform contained more than 2 peaks or more than 1 trough; the peak-to-trough duration (time between the largest peak and largest trough) fell outside 100–1150 µs; the waveform baseline fraction (maximum absolute value in the baseline period preceding the spike, relative to the waveform's absolute peak) exceeded 0.3; or the ratio of the second peak amplitude to the main trough amplitude exceeded 0.8. Additionally, the spatial decay of the waveform was quantified by measuring the absolute peak amplitude on the 10 nearest channels within 33 µm in the x-dimension, as a function of Euclidean distance (in µm) from the peak channel. Amplitudes were normalized to the peak channel, and an exponential fit was applied to obtain the decay slope. Units with a decay slope outside the range 0.01–0.1 were classified as noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-noise units were then evaluated for non-somatic (e.g., axonal) waveform characteristics (Deligkaris et al., 2016). A unit was classified as non-somatic if any of the following criteria were met: the ratio of the largest peak amplitude (before or after the trough) to the main trough amplitude exceeded 0.8; the ratio of the pre-trough peak amplitude to the post-trough peak amplitude exceeded 3; the ratio of the main trough amplitude to the pre-trough peak amplitude was less than 5; the half-prominence width of the pre-trough peak was less than 4 samples; or the half-prominence width of the main trough was less than 5 samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining units were then assessed for single-unit isolation quality, and classified as multi-unit activity (MUA) if any of the following criteria were met. The fraction of refractory period violations was estimated using the method of Hill et al. (2011), with a refractory period of 2.0 ms and a censored period of 0.1 ms; units exceeding 10% violations were classified as MUA. The percentage of missing spikes was estimated by fitting a Gaussian to each unit's amplitude distribution and computing the fraction falling below the detection threshold; units with more than 20% missing spikes were classified as MUA. Units with fewer than 300 total spikes were classified as MUA. The presence ratio was computed by dividing the recording into 60-second bins and calculating the fraction of bins in which the unit's spike count exceeded 5% of the 90th-percentile bin count (inspired by Siegle et al. (2021)); units with a presence ratio below 0.7 were classified as MUA. The raw waveform amplitude (peak-to-trough voltage in µV) was computed from the mean of 100 randomly sampled raw waveforms after linear de-trending; units with an amplitude below 40 µV were classified as MUA. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was defined as the waveform amplitude divided by the standard deviation of the baseline noise; units with an SNR below 5 were classified as MUA.\n",
