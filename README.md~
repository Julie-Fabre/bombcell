Bombcell work with units recorded with Neuropixel probes (3A, 1.0 and 2.0, recorded with SpikeGLX or OpenEphys) and spike-sorted with kilosort. It classifies the unit into three categories: single units, multi-units and noise units, with an option to keep or remove non-somatic spikes. `param` is the structure that defines how to compute the quality metrics and which thresholds to use to classify units.

Used in [Peters et al., Nature, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03166-8) to classify striatal units. See the script `bc_selectAndClassifyStriatum`(work in progress) to classify striatal cells in the same way.

### Getting started 

To install: in MATLAB, clone this repository and the [dependancies](#Dependancies), change your working directory to bombcell\ephysProperties\helpers in matlab and run `mex -O CCGHeart.c`. 

To start out, we suggest you compute quality metrics with default `param` values (contained in `bc_qualityParamValues`), and then adjust the thresholds for your particular neuronal region and needs by looking at (1) individual units, in the interactive [GUI](#Quality-metrics-GUI-guide ) (2) distribution histograms of the units' quality metrics (see General plots), (3) numbers of units removed by each quality metric. It may also be useful to plot the quantity you which to measure as a function of each quality metric (see [Fig. 2 Harris et al., Nat. Neuro, 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4365/figures/2)).

See the script `bc_qualityMetrics_pipeline` for an example workflow. 

### Quality metrics guide

Run all quality metrics with the function `bc_runAllQualityMetrics`. Eg:

    [qMetric, unitTypes] = bc_runAllQualityMetrics(param, spikeTimes, spikeTemplates, ...
      templateWaveforms, templateAmplitudes, pcFeatures, pcFeatureIdx, savePath);

Set `param.plotThis = 1;` to plot figures for each quality metric (plot examples displayed below), and set `param.plotGlobal = 1;` to plot summary of the noise units' waveforms compared to single multi-units, distribution histograms of the units' quality metrics and numbers of units removed by each quality metric. 

#### Classifying noise/non-somatic units 

- Somatic waveforms are defined as waveforms where the largest trough precedes the largest peak (Deligkaris, Bullmann & Frey, 2016). They are lumped together in the 'noise' catefory if `param.somatic` is set to True. 
- Noise units are classified as noise if any of the following are true
    - the number of peaks or troughs detected in the max channel template waveform for the unit exceeds the defined thresholds : `param.maxNPeaks` and `param.maxNTroughs`.
    - the baseline of the max channel template waveform for the unit is not flat (exceeds the defined threshold `param.maxWvBaselineFraction`).
    - the slope template waveform spatial decay is above a defined threshold `param.minSpatialDecaySlope`.

####  Classifying multi-units 

After classifying noise units, the remaining units are classifyed as good single units if the criteria below are met. They are classifying as multi-units otherwise. 

- the estimated percentage of spikes missing is below the `param.maxPercSpikesMissing`

    The percent of spikes missing (false negatives) is estimated by fitting a gaussian the distribution of amplitudes, with a cutoff parameter. This assumes the spike amplitudes follow a gaussian distribution, which is not strictly true for bursty cells, like MSNs. Optionally, if `param.computeTimeChunks` is true, the recording is split in time chunks of size `param.deltaTimeChunk`, and the percentage of spikes missing is estimated seperately on these time chunks. Then, only the time chunks with a percent of spikes missing below the threshold are kept, and the rest of the quality metrics are computed on these epochs. This can be of use in cases where there is a lot of drift during the recording. 

    Below: example of unit with many spikes below the detection threshold in the first two time chunks of the recording. 

    <img style="float: right;" src="https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/blob/master/images/percSpikesMissingDrift.png" width=60% height=60%>

- number of spikes is above `param.minSpikes`

    Below a certain amount of spikes, ephys properties like ACGs will not be reliable. A good minimum to use is 300 empirically, because Kilosort2 does not attempt to split any clusters that have less than 300 spikes in the post-processing phase.

- the estimated percent of refractory period violations is below `param.maxRPVviolations`

    The fraction of refractory period violations (false positives) is estimated using  r = 2*(tauR - tauC) * N^2 * (1-Fp) * Fp / T , solving for Fp, with tauR the refractory period, tauC the censored period, T the total experiment duration, r the number of refractory period violations, Fp the fraction of contamination. method from [Hill et al., J. Neuro, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3123734/). 

    Below: examples of a unit with a small fraction of refractory period violations (left) and one with a large fraction (right).

    <img style="float: right;" src="https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/blob/master/images/rpv.png" width=60% height=60%>


- the raw mean waveform maximum amplitude is above `param.minAmplitude`

    Units with low amplitude are noisy, further away units, that are more likely to be MUA. 

    Below: examples of a unit with high amplitude (blue) and one with low amplitude (red).

    <img style="float: right;" src="https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/blob/master/images/amplitude.png" width=30% height=30%>


- distance metrics are above `param.minIsoD` for the isolation distance, `param.lratioMin` for l-ratio, `param.ssMin` for the silhouette score

    Disabled by default. This is if the most time-consuming part of the script. See [Harris et al., Neuron, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627301004470?via%3Dihub) for more information on isolation distance, (see [Schmitzer-Torbert and Redish, 2004](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00687.2003)) for more information on l-ratio and (see [Rousseeuw, 1987](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0377042787901257) for more information on silhouette-score. 

    Below: examples of a unit with high isolation distance (left) and one with low isolation distance (right).

#### Global output plots 

If `param.plotGlobal` is set to true, after computing quality metrics, the script will output 3 summary plots :

- a [Euler diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_diagram) of the number of units classifyed as noise/multi-unit with each quality metric. Numbers in the circles indicate the number of units classifying as noise/multi-unit by that quality metric/intersection of quality metrics. 

    <img src="https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/blob/master/images/unitRemovedEulerVenn.png" width=60% height=60%>

- for each a quality metric, a histogram of the distribution of values for all units. The red lines indicate classification thresholds. 

    <img src="https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/blob/master/images/generalPlotHist.png" width=100% height=100%>

- template waveforms for each unit classiyed as good, multi-unit and noise, overlaid on top of each other. This is a quick way of checking there is no odd, noisy unit that has mistakenly been classifyed as either good or multi-unit.

    bc_unitQualityGUI(memMapData, ephysData, qMetrics, param, probeLocation, unitType, plotRaw)
   
Toggle units by using the <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> keys. Pressing 'g'Navigate in time through the raw data to see this units' individual spikes with the <kbd>→</kbd> and <kbd>←</kbd> keys.

### Recommended recording and pre-processing 

To reduce the noise units you obtain, we recommend recording with either both a ground wire and reference wire going from the probe to the mouse, or with a ground wire and the internal reference (if using probes other than the 3A - the internal reference on these doesn't work well). To remove artefacts from your recorded data, either temporally align your channels with each other and common-average reference your data with Bill Karsh's function [`CatGT`](https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/), before feeding this data into kilosort or use [pyKilosort](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/pykilosort), where this is implemented. 

To maximize your number of single good units, we recommend looking at your raw data and spikes detected by kilosort, to assess whether most spikes are being detected. If not, consider lowering kilosort's detection thresholds.
