Manual curation of electrophysiology spike sorted units is slow, laborious, and hard to standardize and reproduce. Bombcell is a powerful toolbox that addresses this problem, evaluating the quality of recorded units and extracting essential electrophysiological properties. Bombcell can replace manual curation or can be used as a tool to aid manual curation. See [this talk](https://youtu.be/CvXUtGzkXIY?si=lHkLN885OCb4WJEv) at the annual Neuropixels course about quality control.

üì¢ After many requests, we now have a Python of version of bombcell! See the installation instructions below to get started! üì¢

### üìî Bombcell wiki

Documentation and guides to using and troubleshooting bombcell can be found on the dedicated [wiki](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/wiki).

### üîçÔ∏è How bombcell works

Below is a flowchart of how bombcell evaluates and classifies each unit:

### üèÅ Quick start guide

#### Overview

Bombcell extracts relevant quality metrics to categorize units into four categories: single somatic units, multi-units, noise units and non-somatic units.

Take a look at:
- the MATLAB live script [`gettingStarted`](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/blob/main/gettingStarted.mlx) to see an example workflow and play around with our small toy dataset.
- the Python Jupyter notebook [`BC_demo`](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/blob/main/py_bombcell/demos/BC_demo.ipynb)
- You can also take a look at the exercise we prepared for the 2024 Neuropixels course [here](https://github.com/BombCell/Neuropixels_course_2024). 

#### Installation
##### Matlab
Bombcell requires MATLAB>=2019a.

To begin using Bombcell:
- [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the [repository](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/bombcell) and the [dependencies](#Dependencies). You can do this either via git/GitHub desktop or directly by downloading the .zip file and decompressing it. 
- add bombcell's and the dependancies' folders to [MATLAB's path](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pathtool.html).
- in addition, if you want to compute ephys properties, change your working directory to `bombcell\+bc\+ep\+helpers` in matlab and run `mex -O CCGHeart.c` to able to compute fast ACGs, using part of the [FMAToolbox](https://fmatoolbox.sourceforge.net/).

###### Dependencies

- [npy-matlab](https://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab), to load .npy data in.
- If you have z-lib compressed ephys data, compressed with [mtscomp](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/mtscomp), you will need the [zmat toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71434-zmat). More information about compressing ephys data [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/05/24/2023.05.22.541700.full.pdf?%3Fcollection=).
- [prettify-matlab](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/prettify_matlab), to make plots pretty.
- MATLAB toolboxes:
    - Signal Processing Toolbox
    - Image Processing Toolbox
    - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
    - Parallel Computing Toolbox
    - Optimization Toolbox

In addition we would like to acknowledge:
- to compute fast ACGs, we use a function (`CCGHeart.c`) part of the [FMAToolbox](https://fmatoolbox.sourceforge.net/), and it is already included in bombcell.
- to read in spikeGLX meta data, we use a function from Jennifer Colonell's [SpikeGLX_Datafile_Tools](https://github.com/jenniferColonell/SpikeGLX_Datafile_Tools) repository. 

#### Python 

##### Latest stable version

```bash
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n bombcell python=3.11
conda activate bombcell
# Install bombcell
pip install uv
uv pip install bombcell # you could do `pip install .`, but uv is much quicker!
```
##### Dev version (with the latest updates): 
```bash
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n bombcell python=3.11
conda activate bombcell
# Clone latest bombcell repository from github
git clone https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell.git
cd bombcell/pyBombCell
# Install bombcell
pip install uv
uv pip install -e .
```
